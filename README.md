# Getting and Cleaning Data: Project

## Task to Accomplish

Using the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, [found here]( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Data Set Download"), an R script called `run_analysis.R` needs to be created that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    

### 1. Merge Data Sets

Identifying each file in the data set for what it represents is the key step here:
* `features.txt` is the list of variable names
* `subject_test.txt` is the labelling of the 9 subjects involved in the test subset
* `subject_train.txt` is the labelling of the 21 subjects involved in the train subset
* `x_test.txt` is
* `x_train.txt` is
* `y_test.txt` is
* `y_train.txt` is

### 2. Extract Mean and Standard Deviation

### 3. Name Activities With Descriptive Names

### 4. Label Data Set with Descriptive Variable Names

### 5. Create Tidy Data Set
